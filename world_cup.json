I was so excited about what could happen,\u201d said Bill Manning, president of Toronto FC, speaking to reporters at BMO Field. \u201cIt\u2019s officially football Christmas for Canada,\u201d said John Herdman, head coach of the national men\u2019s team. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those mornings, you wonder if Santa\u2019s going to come. And he absolutely did this morning.\u201d The idea that, in eight years time, Canada will become the 19th country to welcome the world\u2019s biggest sporting event to its shores is fantastical enough to send big imaginations racing. It was only six years ago that Victor Montagliani, then president of Canada Soccer, first broached the idea of Canada making a play for a men\u2019s World Cup, a brainwave that, at the time, was dismissed as a pipe dream. Maybe it was a tad ridiculous, the concept of little old Canada single-handedly rolling out the red carpet \u2014 or, for that matter, the green carpet on which they still play professional matches at Montreal\u2019s Olympic Stadium \u2014 for all of soccer-playing humanity. The idea evolved. And what we\u2019re talking about here, a three-country blueprint that currently has the United States absorbing 60 games while Canada and Mexico put on 10 apiece, is far less daunting. It could even be seen as inspiring, a boon to the currently dismal state of Canada-U.S.-Mexico relations. What are the chances the NAFTA triumvirate can co-operate to make this tournament a hit? Well, in 2026 Trump won\u2019t be president. Or, at least, this Trump. Still, as much as the win was exhilarating to the sport\u2019s devotees, it had to be at least a little spooky to Canada\u2019s taxpayers. If there\u2019s ever going to exist a more scandal-plagued, corruption-assumed sporting organization on the planet than soccer\u2019s global governing body, it\u2019ll need to do a lot of shady business to catch up to FIFA\u2019s historic record of malfeasance. When you enter a room with the men who control the world\u2019s various soccer federations, lucrative fiefdoms all, you hold onto your wallet and hold your breath. You\u2019re going to walk out poorer, for sure. But hopefully not too much poorer. A cynic could say the smell of money proved overpowering again on Wednesday. While Morocco had considerable support \u2014 the United Bid won the vote 134-65 \u2014 the North African country\u2019s projected revenues were about half of what the United Bid was promising. That\u2019ll be profit in FIFA\u2019s pocket. Meanwhile the uncertainty around the possible hidden costs of putting on World Cup games, specifically ever-ballooning security costs that FIFA foists on organizers, drove British Columbia\u2019s government to remove Vancouver from consideration as a host city. Toronto, Edmonton and Montreal are the three Canadian cities left standing. The latest iteration of the United Bid\u2019s plan has BMO Field hosting an opening-day game among its slate. But nothing is finalized. Herdman\u2019s Canadian team, as it is, still isn\u2019t guaranteed a spot in the 48-team field, although it\u2019s nearly unfathomable that that won\u2019t be worked out in the months to come. And if you can get past doing business with FIFA \u2014 if your country can get in and out without spending the billions in public money that, say, Brazil spent on the 2014 tournament \u2014 you can make the case the end can justify the means. The end, if you talk to the soccer romantics, could be the foundation that transforms an undeniably enthusiastic soccer nation into a globally competitive one, the way the 1994 World Cup in the United States helped turn our neighbours to the south into a more formidable force. Canada, as much as it has established itself as a contender in the women\u2019s game, remains a minnow on the men\u2019s side. A team wearing the Maple Leaf has never won a match at the World Cup \u2014 never even scored a goal. Canada has only qualified for the tournament once, in 1986, when the field consisted of 24 teams. And Herdman makes the case that those depressing realities have long infected the game here. At least a couple of generations of aspiring players and coaches have never enjoyed the experience of cheering for Canada on the global stage. \u201cThat experience that gives you goosebumps. That experience that gets you shouting at the TV. That experience that makes you want to stand taller for Canada and do things that you wouldn\u2019t normally do for other people in your country. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got right in front of us now,\u201d Herdman told reporters Wednesday. \u201cAnd I\u2019d just ask every Canadian to unite around this one opportunity, this one vision. It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime thing. There are people who would kill for this opportunity. For a World Cup to come to your town, your city. And it\u2019s coming. So let\u2019s unite. It\u2019s time. We\u2019re clear. We want to take a team to the World Cup, not to participate, but to compete.\u201d So that makes two realistic goals here: Don\u2019t get ripped off, and don\u2019t be happy just getting in. In a conversation last week Herdman made the case that Canada\u2019s team needs to take aim at winning games in the tournament \u2014 or, heck, one game \u2014 rather than simply revelling in a participation ribbon. And qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be an important step in that progression. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we can win the World Cup. I\u2019m saying we can compete. No different to Costa Rica. No different to Iceland or Wales. We can compete. We can be a story of a tournament,\u201d Herdman said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Canada can do. We can definitely compete. At the minute, we\u2019re not competing. Because we\u2019re not there.\u201d There\u2019s every chance Canada will be there \u2014 er, here \u2014 eight years from now, a football Christmas that could bring with it the gift of a transformed future in the beautiful game.", "link": "https://www.thespec.com/news-story/8672546-world-cup-a-soccer-gift-that-could-keep-giving-for-canada/", "img_api": "", "img_api_thumb": "", "pubdate_api": "2018-06-14T14:52:57.673", "timestamp": "06-14 2:52 pm", "site_api": "Hamilton Spectator", "author_api": "Dave Feschuk", "label_api": "OPINION | Dave Feschuk | The Star", "draft_api": false}, "29": {"desc_user": "", "draft_user": 0, "rank": 0, "rank_time": 0, "label_user": "", "title_user": "", "tags_user": [], "asset_id": "8671970", "title_api": "Benefits of Toronto hosting World Cup games outweigh the costs, Mayor Tory says", "source_api": "Toronto Star", "tags_api": [], "caption_api": "Toronto mayor John Tory discusses the successful joint North American bid by Canada, the U.S. and Mexico to host the 2026 World Cup on Wednesday.", "categories_api": ["World Cup", "Sports"], "desc_api": "The chance for Canada, and by extension Toronto, to jointly host a World Cup is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, with the financial benefits outweighing the costs, according to Mayor John Tory. The estimate for the city\u2019s share of expenditures is in the $30 million range, a \u201cmodest\u201d investment for a \u201chuge likely return\u201d in terms of tourism and worldwide attention, Tory said on Wednesday morning, after Canada, the United States and Mexico won the rights to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. \u201cThere is no place in the world that will respond to the World Cup games being played here with more enthusiasm, more energy and more competitiveness, frankly, than the city of Toronto,\u201d Tory said. The United 2026 bid was officially selected over Morocco\u2019s bid during the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow. Canada will likely host 10 of the tournament\u2019s 80 games, with another 10 to be played in Mexico and the remaining 60 held in the United States. Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton were among 23 potential host cities named in the bid, a number that is expected to be whittled down to 16. Canadian officials say they will push to keep all three of their host cities. Toronto \u2014 which could host one of three back-to-back opening day games, one in each country, at BMO Field \u2014 doesn\u2019t yet know how many matches it will get, but Tory supports the joint bid and said the limited number of games allows the city to contain costs. Tory said the city\u2019s share of the cost will cover things like fan expos and transportation issues. He expects the adjustments to the infrastructure to be modest, but it is something that was assumed when the city got on board with the bid. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to look at this as an opportunity, not a problem,\u201d Tory said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a problem. It\u2019s a huge opportunity to put this city and country on the map. We\u2019re on the map all the time, but we\u2019ve got to keep putting this city and country on the map and to do it in the sporting world \u2014 in the soccer, football world \u2014 is a huge opportunity to expose this city and this country to literally billions of people, to attract thousands of tourists to come here.\u201d There will also be significant costs associated with security for the event, but Tory said the city is counting on the partnerships with other governments to make that happen. \u201cThey have at their disposal not only the financial resources but, more importantly, the policing and security resources to make sure we do that well,\u201d he said. Tory pointed to the city\u2019s recent experience hosting the Pan Am/Parapan Am Games in 2015 and the Invictus Games in 2017 as blueprints for making the proper arrangements for the World Cup, though he expects the 2026 tournament to be narrower in scope than the Pan Am Games, given the tournament will be confined to a single principle venue, BMO Field, and a few smaller sites for practices. The stadium will also get an upgrade for the World Cup, with the capacity growing from about 15,000 seats to 45,000 thanks to temporary stands in the north and south end, like the setup for last year\u2019s MLS Cup final and the NHL\u2019s Centennial Classic in 2016. \u201cRight now the plan that we submitted was for temporary (seats), which meet the FIFA standards but \u2026 as we continue to grow, it may be that we decide that we make them permanent,\u201d Toronto FC president Bill Manning said. \u201cThat is something over the next eight years that we\u2019ll look at from a (Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment) standpoint, an Exhibition Place standpoint.\u201d Tory said the city has yet to invest any money in the venture. His involvement so far adds up to phone calls, letters and meetings with FIFA officials to sell them on Toronto.
