For a crash course on the crazy haircuts, celebrity girlfriends and, yes, actual soccer, for this World Cup, which begins in Russia on June 14, we spoke to Roger Bennett, the Liverpool-bred New Yorker who is a host of Men in Blazers, the irreverent soccer site, podcast and TV show: The World Cup is the ultimate stage for an emergent global superstar. Who is this year\u2019s most likely candidate? The game\u2019s breakout star is the young Egyptian Mohamed Salah, who plays the game with the ebullience of an Ewok. The Liverpool striker has just been anointed the Premier League\u2019s player of the year, and the public displays of his Muslim faith that he brings to the field have transcended football. He has become an icon throughout the Middle East, and a one-man bulwark against rising European Islamophobia. His race to return from a dislocated shoulder has the continent of Africa on tenterhooks. They will need the man for whom Liverpool fans have composed the following anthem, to greet every goal he scores: \u201cIf he\u2019s good enough for you, he\u2019s good enough for me, if he scores another few, then I\u2019ll be Muslim too.\u201d Players like David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo have leveraged World Cup exposure to establish themselves as sex symbols. Who\u2019s this year\u2019s hunk? There is only one Ronaldo, a supremely gifted player, yet one so self-obsessed that he only seems to score so he can take his shirt off and expose his eight-pack to the world. A more nuanced hypebeast is Antoine Griezmann. He is a French striker who catches the eye with dashing streetwear and goal celebrations that echo Drake dance moves, not to his mention chameleonic looks, which flick between \u201cclean cut\u201d to \u201cdyed-blonde Justin Bieber-on-three-day-bender.\u201d Hairstyles are always a part of the fun. Who is this year\u2019s breakout tonsorial star? The current champion is France\u2019s Paul Pogba. He uses his hair to express his mood, shaving in a new design and unfurling a new hair colour every game to guarantee he will rack up even more likes on social media than goals and assists on the field. Even so, I am a firm believer that here are only six kinds of soccer haircuts, and David Beckham has already invented all of them. A number of prominent teams failed to qualify. Who will be missed the most? Chile will be missed, if only for the sheer number of creative neck tattoos they bring to the party. The Netherlands stunning orange jerseys are irreplaceable. Above all, I rue Italy having a rare damp squib of a World Cup qualification campaign. A World Cup without them feels like The Office once Steve Carell quit. Which perennial power is most likely to disappoint? Argentina is packed with elite talent, with Lionel Messi their crown jewel. The five-foot-seven Barcelona star may look like he has just wandered out of Supercuts on Las Ramblas, but his superhuman touch and acceleration have made him one of the greatest ever to play the game. Messi is Argentina\u2019s greatest strength, but Messi overreliance is their biggest weakness. Their biggest players defer to Lionel like Cavaliers players seeking comfort in LeBron James\u2019 shadow. Is this the year that the ever-talented England squad finally avoids humiliation? Ah, England. Every four years, they arrive at the World Cup hoping for \u201cLand of Hope and Glory,\u201d only to limp away, painfully aware of the fall of their Empire. The one thing England remains world-class at is tabloid media. As a result, English players are guaranteed to play with fear. Uruguayan or Egyptian players run through walls when they pull on their national team jerseys. The English shrink, as if those jerseys are made of chain mail. Who is this year\u2019s most exciting squad? Belgium, that flat land of wonder, home to such avant-garde minds as Adolphe Sax, inventor of the saxophone. Somehow that nation of 11 million people has produced a golden generation of elite, attacking footballers.

The reigning world champions already have proved they can beat Mexico, the team they play in their group-stage opener, as well as Lionel Messi\u2019s Argentina and Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Portugal. They\u2019ve played France, Spain and England to draws in the past seven months. The foe Germany might have trouble overcoming, however, is history. Since 1938, only one country, Brazil, has won back-to-back World Cups, something the Germans will be trying to do this summer. That makes the targets on the backs of their uniforms especially heavy, says midfielder Ilkay Gundogan. \u201cOver the last three years, every team that we played against, they were just trying to beat the world champions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it really hard. \u201cThere are more contenders than just Germany. But of course we are the champions. And hopefully we\u2019re going to be able to defend the title. That is our challenge.\u201d Germany returns nine players from the 2014 world championship team, but many of those missing were key contributors, among them captains Bastian Schweinsteiger and Philipp Lahm; forward Miroslav Klose, the top goal scorer in World Cup history, and forwards Mario Gotze and Andre Schurrle, who came off the bench to combine on the only goal in the last World Cup final. Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil, who started all seven games in Brazil four years ago, soon could join that list because of a knee injury in last week\u2019s game with Austria. \u201cThose players, they were essential for the World Cup trophy,\u201d said Gundogan, who missed the 2014 tournament because of a back injury. \u201cThe real challenge is not to replace these kinds of players. But in Germany, we have a lot of talent, so the potential is definitely there. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to show it.\u201d Indeed, depth may be Germany\u2019s strength. The team won the Confederations Cup \u2014 an eight-team, pre-World Cup tournament \u2014in Russia last summer with what was basically a \u201cB\u201d team. But that, too, may be a bad omen; no Confederations Cup winner has repeated as World Cup champion. \u201cYou can do it,\u201d said former Argentine international Mario Kempes. \u201cBut doing it is difficult.\u201d Kempes scored a tournament-high six goals \u2014 including two in the final \u2014 to lead Argentina to a World Cup title in 1978. Four years later, Argentina was knocked out in the second round. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the same mentality that we did in 1978. And we didn\u2019t have the best players,\u201d he explained. \u201cEveryone plays with the objective of being champion. But it\u2019s difficult to do. \u201cEverything depends on your mentality.\u201d That mentality can be shaped by expectation. Four years ago, Brazil, playing at home, was a strong World Cup favourite, and its players wilted under the pressure, stumbling into the semifinals where it was pummelled 7-1 by Germany. This summer, that pressure falls on Germany, which has been ranked No. 1 in the world for much of the last four years. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a lot easier when you\u2019re the underdog,\u201d said Herculez Gomez, who played in three World Cup games for the U.S. \u201cWhen you\u2019re the top dog and you have a target on your back, every single move will be scrutinized, will be talked about, will be analyzed. \u201cYou\u2019re really in a no-win situation.\u201d Germany appears equipped to handle it given the steady hand at the wheel. Joachim Low has coached the national team since 2006, guiding it not just to World Cup and Confederations Cup titles, but to the semifinals of three consecutive European Championships and a third-place finish in the 2010 World Cup. It is arguably the most impressive coaching resume in international soccer history. And even after the roster turnover of the last four years, the team Low will lead in Russia will be among the deepest and most experienced in the tournament. \u201cThe best way for me to deal with (pressure) was just to focus from game to game,\u201d Schweinsteiger said. \u201cThe coach knows what to do.\u201d Put it all together \u2014a deep roster, seasoned players, the most successful coach in international soccer with experience in handling pressure \u2014and it\u2019s hard not to see Germany defying history by winning again. And that\u2019s exactly what Schweinsteiger and Gomez expect. \u201cMy personal feeling is yes,\u201d said Schweinsteiger, who retired from the national team after the 2016 European Championships and now plays in Major League Soccer with the Chicago Fire. \u201cBut I know how hard it is, especially when you are one of the favourites and all the eyes are on you.\u201d Added Gomez: \u201cThey\u2019re good enough and they\u2019re supposed to win. Most likely they get there and they do win. \u201cThat\u2019s a machine you\u2019re talking about. This German team is unlike any I\u2019ve seen.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thespec.com/news-story/8667271-germany-enters-world-cup-hoping-to-overcome-history/", "img_api": "", "img_api_thumb": "", "pubdate_api": "2018-06-12T13:41:20.787", "timestamp": "06-12 1:41 pm", "site_api": "Hamilton Spectator", "author_api": "Kevin Baxter ", "label_api": "Kevin Baxter  | Los Angeles Times", "draft_api": false}, "26": {"desc_user": "", "draft_user": 0, "rank": 0, "rank_time": 0, "label_user": "", "title_user": "", "tags_user": [], "asset_id": "8667226", "title_api": "After series of heartbreaks, Panama prepares for World Cup debut in Russia", "source_api": "Los Angeles Times", "tags_api": [], "caption_api": "", "categories_api": ["World Cup", "Soccer", "Sports"], "desc_api": "MOSCOW\u2014Donald Trump isn\u2019t the only president who governs by tweet. Panamanian leader Juan Carlos Varela has also embraced the idea of issuing official decrees in 280 characters or fewer, taking to Twitter in October to declare a national holiday moments after his country qualified for its first-ever World Cup. \u201cThe voice of the people has been heard,\u201d Varela wrote beneath a picture of himself, in a red national team jacket, signing the presidential order. And although the holiday has ended, the celebration hasn\u2019t, which could necessitate another Twitter proclamation ahead of Panama\u2019s tournament opener against Belgium. \u201cI can\u2019t say. The president\u2019s in charge of that,\u201d midfielder Anibal Godoy said with a laugh. \u201cBut I think a lot of people are going to miss work.\u201d You couldn\u2019t blame Panamanians for pausing to pinch themselves in the midst of the revelry though, just to make sure they\u2019re not dreaming. The country appeared to have a ticket punched to the World Cup four years ago, only to have it slip through their fingers when the U.S. scored twice in stoppage time of the final CONCACAF qualifier, eliminating Panama and opening the way for Mexico to go to Brazil instead. So there may have been a bit of karma at work this time around, with Roman Torres\u2019 goal with two minutes left in the final qualifier last fall beating Costa Rica to eliminate the U.S. from World Cup consideration, sending Panama on to Russia instead. \u201cFour years ago, the Panamanian people were really disappointed. There were a lot of people crying, very sad,\u201d Torres, a defender with the Seattle Sounders, said in Spanish. \u201cLast year was something really motivating. A lot of people were crying again (this year), but crying for joy. \u201cWe made history. Panama is going to the World Cup for the first time.\u201d And it may have made it just in time since Panama\u2019s \u201cGolden Generation\u201d is growing old. The average age of the starting lineup Panama used in the last qualifier was 30.36 years, led by former Galaxy goalkeeper Jaime Penedo, 36, and forward Blas Perez, 37, who scored the team\u2019s first goal in that game. Penedo and Perez are two of 12 current or former MLS players on Panama\u2019s World Cup roster. Penedo, who won an MLS Cup with the Galaxy in 2014 and a Romanian first-division title with Dinamo Bucuresti last year, has had an oversized role in Panama\u2019s success. He posted four shutouts in the final round of World Cup qualifying \u2014 blanking both Mexico and Costa Rica \u2014 and was named the top goalkeeper in both the 2005 and 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cups, the only two times in which Panama made the final. But although the Central Americans will field one of the oldest teams in the World Cup, they are also bringing some youth with them in defender Fidel Escobar, 23, midfielder Edgar Barcenas, 24, and forward Abdiel Arroyo, 24, who joined the team after the last World Cup cycle. The mix is important if Panama hopes to make World Cup qualification a regular thing. \u201cI hope the World Cup changes things and brings good players to the local leagues and then players from the local leagues can go and play in better foreign leagues,\u201d said Godoy, who plays for the San Jose Earthquakes. Another addition to the team is Colombian coach Hernan Gomez, who replaced Julio Cesar Dely Valdes after the 2013 qualifying loss to the U.S. Gomez previously led Colombia and Ecuador to World Cup berths and his hiring, Godoy said, was the final piece to the puzzle for Panama. \u201cNow it\u2019s different,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different coach. The players have more experience. The young players have more experience as well. \u201cThe team has heart. And always will have.\u201d That isn\u2019t likely to be enough to get them through one of the most difficult groups in the tournament, one that has Panama making its World Cup debut against Belgium \u2014 the No. 3 team in the world, according to FIFA. But Torres disagrees with many of his countrymen who argue that simply getting to Russia is victory enough for Panama. \u201cPeople say \u2018they made it, winning isn\u2019t important.\u2019 But we have a clear objective,\u201d said Torres, the team\u2019s captain. \u201cIt\u2019s something historic to qualify for a World Cup, but after you qualify what comes next is more difficult. \u201cYeah it\u2019s a really difficult group. But you can\u2019t really say one team is better than another. In football, anything can happen.\u201d No World Cup team knows that better than Panama, which looked to be in four years ago, only to be knocked out, then looked to be out eight months ago, only to be invited in. So although making it this far may not be enough for Torres, it\u2019s still worth celebrating. Maybe even with a national holiday declared on Twitter. \u201cBefore the first game begins, when we hear the first line of the national anthem, it\u2019s going to be something special for Panama,\u201d Godoy said. \u201cThis World Cup, we\u2019ve prepared for this.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thespec.com/news-story/8667226-after-series-of-heartbreaks-panama-prepares-for-world-cup-debut-in-russia/", "img_api": "", "img_api_thumb": "", "pubdate_api": "2018-06-12T13:33:16.317", "timestamp": "06-12 1:33 pm", "site_api": "Hamilton Spectator", "author_api": "Kevin Baxter ", "label_api": "Kevin Baxter  | Los Angeles Times", "draft_api": false}, "27": {"desc_user": "", "draft_user": 0, "rank": 0, "rank_time": 0, "label_user": "", "title_user": "", "tags_user": [], "asset_id": "8667257", "title_api": "FIFA signs Egypt government to World Cup sponsor deal", "source_api": "The Canadian Press", "tags_api": [], "caption_api": "", "categories_api": ["Soccer", "Sports"], "desc_api": "FIFA signs Egypt government to World Cup sponsor deal", "link": "https://www.thespec.com/news-story/8667257-fifa-signs-egypt-government-to-world-cup-sponsor-deal/", "img_api": "", "img_api_thumb": "", "pubdate_api": "2018-06-12T13:31:29", "timestamp": "06-12 1:31 pm", "site_api": "", "author_api": "", "label_api": "The Canadian Press", "draft_api": false}, "28": {"desc_user": "", "draft_user": 0, "rank": 0, "rank_time": 0, "label_user": "", "title_user": "", "tags_user": [], "asset_id": "8667251", "title_api": "Alberta expands liquor hours during World Cup", "source_api": "The Canadian Press", "tags_api": [], "caption_api": "Alberta Finance Minister Joe Ceci speaks about the Government of Alberta&#8217;s 2016-17 year-end financial results, in Edmonton on Thursday, June 29, 2017.

An eight-year campaign to promote soccer in Canada can begin, perhaps cracking the global consciousness and the upper echelon of professional sport in this country, where hockey reigns supreme. And the men\u2019s national team, ranked No. 79 in the world and with a lone World Cup appearance to its name 32 years ago, will finally have a major tournament to work toward. Those are the hopes of the Canadian soccer community as decision day looms. It\u2019s United 2026 \u2014 a joint bid by the United States, Mexico and Canada \u2014 versus Morocco for the right to host the World Cup in eight years, with the winner to be announced in Moscow around the time Canadians are waking up on Wednesday morning. Participation rates are already high. There were about 834,363 registered soccer players, coaches and referees in Canada in 2017, according to a report by the Canadian Soccer Association. But alongside the prospect of hosting the sport\u2019s biggest tournament, a desire to move soccer closer to the mainstream has emerged, with emphasis on what that growth could do for the game for generations to come. Soccer has made a lot of progress in Canada with three Major League Soccer teams, a thriving women\u2019s national program and the emergence of the Canadian Premier League on the horizon. But it\u2019s still a young sport here, said Richard Legendre, executive vice-president of soccer operations with the Montreal Impact. \u201c(The World Cup) could be an accelerator,\u201d he said last week. There\u2019s a big difference between how MLS is perceived around the world today compared with six years ago, when the Impact began, Legendre added. Clubs are acquiring more talent from Europe, South and Central America, for example. The quality of play has improved and with it the perception of soccer in North America, which hosting a World Cup could take to another level. \u201cIt reminds me a little bit of all the movements \u2026 when you hold the Olympics at home,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great rally behind developing players at home. It\u2019s almost as important as the promotional side. To develop international players, it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. There\u2019s no magic, in any sport.\u201d Toronto FC president Bill Manning considers soccer a \u201cgreat unifier,\u201d bringing Canadians together around the game like the Women\u2019s World Cup did here in 2015. \u201cI think as soccer continues to proliferate in Canada, having the World Cup and kids seeing players playing at the highest level in the world that are kids here from the GTA, they can be role models,\u201d Manning said. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. \u201cI\u2019m sure in hockey you have that, kids that looked up to a Wayne Gretzky or even a Brendan (Shanahan) when he was playing. They aspire to that and they can identify because they\u2019re local guys. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see as well with Canada.\u201d Pathways to the pros already exist, such as MLS academies, but Manning believes a World Cup would \u201camplify everything, which can only help the sport in this country.\u201d Shaun Hammond, president of Alberta Soccer, said just the notion of bringing a tournament of this stature to Canada inspires kids to stay in the game and want to be a part of it. \u201cI think it will change a lot of attitudes were we to get this kind of tournament here, this kind of exposure,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cI think people will start taking a lot of notice.\u201d But for all the optimism, Simon Darnell, an assistant professor in kinesiology and physical education at the University of Toronto, finds the question of what the World Cup would do for soccer in Canada a bit mystifying. Grassroots participation is already very strong, says Darnell, who studies how sports fits into society and culture. He adds research shows that while hosting major events and having famous athletes play in your country may lead to a spike in interest in a sport, it doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into increased participation. Instead, much of what sports mean in Canada is driven by elite performance, he says, pointing to the Own the Podium program for the Olympics. While Canadians have had success at the Games, the project also feeds a sense that sport doesn\u2019t mean anything unless athletes are winning at the highest level. \u201cI think there\u2019s a sense among Canadian soccer (stakeholders) that they\u2019re kind of desperate to play with the big boys, to actually be in the big tournament,\u201d Darnell said. \u201cIn this line of thinking, it\u2019s not enough potentially to have a real grassroots soccer culture in this country.\u201d Which leaves Darnell with what he calls the \u201cmost cynical\u201d benefit of Canada\u2019s role in the bid: that it might be the only way for the Canadian men, as co-hosts, to get back into the tournament in the foreseeable future. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that, at some level, is playing a role here,\u201d he said. \u201cI think with the Canadian Soccer Association, it would force them to actually develop a team that would have to be able to play in the tournament. We don\u2019t see many signs that that\u2019s going to happen otherwise.\u201d", "link": "https://www.thespec.com/news-story/8667355-world-cup-bounce-might-play-well-in-canada/", "img_api": "", "img_api_thumb": "", "pubdate_api": "2018-06-12T14:05:15.663", "timestamp": "06-12 2:05 pm", "site_api": "Hamilton Spectator", "author_api": "Laura Armstrong ", "label_api": "Laura Armstrong  | The Star", "draft_api": false}, "32": {"desc_user": "", "draft_user": 1, "rank": 0, "rank_time": 0, "label_user": "", "title_user": "", "tags_user": [], "asset_id": "8667396", "title_api": "Impact, Orlando both hungry for wins", "source_api": "The Canadian Press", "tags_api": [], "caption_api": "Montreal Impact midfielder Ignacio Piatti and Orlando City SC forward Will Johnson battle for the ball during second half MLS action Saturday, August 5, 2017 in Montreal.
